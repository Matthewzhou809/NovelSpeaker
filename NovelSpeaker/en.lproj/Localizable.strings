# Version 1.0.2 release note

Change of the interface

- I attached a button for the front and the movement to a later chapter with the screen which read a novel. By the right and left flick cannot move now.

Correction of the problem

- I revise the problem that the latest thing which I reloaded was not able to download.
- When I moved a chapter during background reproduction, I revise the problem that reproduction might stop.
- I revise the problem that the indication of the novel is fogged in a status bar and navigation bar, and it may not seem that it is displayed.
- I revise a reproduction start and the problem that I am replaced, and nothing sometimes reacts to for a long time of the chapter when I increase the setting of the reading substitute. (if the number increases, it becomes late)
- Movement revises the problem that became slow if in condition to have downloaded a large quantity of novels.


# Version 1.0 release note

First release.
